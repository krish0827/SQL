Consider P1 and P2 to be two points on a 2D plane.

 a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1  and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

select round(ABS(MAX(LAT_N) - MIN(LAT_N)) + ABS(MIN(LONG_W) - MAX(LONG_W)),4) FROM STATION;
